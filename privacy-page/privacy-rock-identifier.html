        <h2>How We Use Your Camera</h2>
        <p>When you scan rock and mineral photos, images are processed locally on your device and sent securely to OpenAPI for geological identification analysis. Images are not stored on our servers and are only used for the analysis you requested.</p>

        <p>We use AI to analyze rock and mineral photos and provide geological identification with confidence scoring. The image data is transmitted securely for processing according to their privacy policy. No personal information is included with these requests.</p>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Your scan history, rock identification results, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using SwiftData. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share specific results.</p>

        <h2>Premium Subscriptions</h2>
