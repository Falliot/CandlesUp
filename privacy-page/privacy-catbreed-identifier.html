             <h1>Cat Breed Identifier - Privacy Policy</h1>

             <h2>How We Use Your Camera</h2>
             <p>When you scan cat photos, images are processed locally on your device and sent securely to OpenAI's API for breed
     identification analysis. Images are not stored on our servers and are only used for the analysis you requested.</p>

             <h2>AI Analysis & Data Processing</h2>
             <p>We use OpenAI's API to analyze cat photos and provide breed identification with confidence scoring. The image
     data is transmitted securely for processing according to their privacy policy. No personal information is included with these
     requests.</p>

             <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
             <p>Your scan history, breed identification results, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using SwiftData. This

      any third-party analytics services.</p>

             <h2>Data Retention</h2>
             <p>Breed identification history is stored locally on your device. You can delete individual scans or clear all history at any time
      through the app. If you delete the app, all data is permanently removed from your device.</p>

             <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

     networks, social media trackers, or other third-party analytics services.</p>

             <h2>Feature Requests & Feedback</h2>
