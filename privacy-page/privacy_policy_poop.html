        <h1>Poop Salary - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 21, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Poop Salary ("the App") is a humorous utility app that calculates earnings during bathroom breaks. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the data we collect and how we use it.</p>
        
        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Most of your data is stored locally on your device and never leaves your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salary information (hourly rate or annual salary)</li>
            <li>Session history (bathroom break timings and durations)</li>
            <li>App preferences (sound settings, notification preferences, app icon choice)</li>
            <li>Currency and work hours settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored using iOS standard UserDefaults and SwiftData, and is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>
        
        <h2>Analytics Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We use Mixpanel analytics to understand how users interact with the app and improve the user experience. The following information is collected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous user identifier:</strong> A randomly generated UUID stored on your device to distinguish unique users</li>
            <li><strong>App events:</strong> Actions you take within the app (e.g., completing onboarding, changing settings, making purchases)</li>
            <li><strong>Event properties:</strong> Non-personal context about events (e.g., which app icon you selected, notification permission status)</li>
            <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Basic device metadata automatically collected by Mixpanel</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What we DO NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your actual salary amounts or earnings calculations</li>
            <li>Session timings or durations</li>
            <li>Your name, email, or contact information</li>
            <li>Your location data</li>
            <li>Any personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analytics data is processed on servers located in the EU. For more information, see <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>If you grant notification permissions, the App schedules local notifications on your device to remind you about bathroom breaks. These notifications are handled entirely by iOS and do not involve any remote servers or data transmission.</p>
        
        <h2>In-App Purchases (Tip Jar)</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional tips that you can purchase to support development. All purchases are processed through Apple's StoreKit framework. We collect the following purchase-related information through our analytics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product ID and price of items viewed or purchased</li>
            <li>Purchase success or failure status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Actual payment processing and transaction data are handled exclusively by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID.</p>
        
        <h2>Widgets</h2>
        <p>If you add the App's widget to your home screen or lock screen, the widget displays information calculated locally on your device. Widget interactions may be tracked through analytics to improve the widget experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mixpanel:</strong> Analytics platform for tracking app usage and events. Data is processed according to <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> For processing in-app purchases. Governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use advertising networks, social media SDKs, or third-party tracking for marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Local data stored on your device remains until you delete the app or manually clear it through the app settings. If you delete the App, all locally stored data is permanently removed from your device.</p>
        <p>Analytics data collected by Mixpanel is retained according to their data retention policies. If you wish to request deletion of your analytics data, please contact us at the email below.</p>
